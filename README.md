This project contains a single C++ code snippet; one header file, one CPP, with no external dependencies, to rapidly and efficiently parse the raw bitcoin block-chain on your hard drive; assuming you are running the official bitcoin client.

Builds out of the box for either windows with Visual Studio for for Linux using standard make

It also contains individual code snippets to show how to compute an SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash as well as convert bitcoin addresses to and from binary and ASCII formats.

Finally, it contains a console application which lets you parse and query the blockchain for statistics and reporting.
